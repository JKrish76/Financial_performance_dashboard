# Financial Sales Dashboard - Power BI Project

This repository contains the files and summary for a business intelligence dashboard created using Power BI. The project visualizes financial data from a sample dataset to track key performance indicators (KPIs) and uncover insights for business stakeholders.

## üìã Project Objective
The main goal of this project was to design and build an interactive and user-friendly dashboard for business stakeholders. The dashboard aims to provide a high-level overview of sales and profit performance while also allowing for detailed analysis by country, product, and customer segment. The ultimate outcome is a tool that empowers business leaders to make data-driven decisions.

## üìä Dataset
The dataset used is the **"Financial Sample"**, which contains fictional sales data from a global company. It includes transactional information with the following key columns:
- **Sales & Financials:** Gross Sales, Discounts, Net Sales, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), Profit
- **Categorical Data:** Segment, Country, Product, Discount Band
- **Time Series Data:** Date (Year, Month)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- **Data Visualization:** Microsoft Power BI
- **Data Source:** CSV (`Financial Sample.xlsx - Sheet1.csv`)

## ‚ú® Dashboard Features
The dashboard is designed to be comprehensive yet intuitive, incorporating the following features:

1.  **KPI Cards:** At-a-glance metrics for a quick overview of business health:
    - **Total Sales:** \$118.72M
    - **Total Profit:** \$16.89M
    - **Total Units Sold:** 1.6M
    - **Total Discounts:** \$6.21M

2.  **Interactive Slicers & Filters:** Dynamic filters that allow users to drill down into the data by:
    - Country
    - Product
    - Customer Segment
    - Year

3.  **Time-Series Analysis:** A line chart visualizing **Sales and Profit over time**, helping to identify trends, seasonality, and growth patterns.

4.  **Categorical Analysis:**
    - **Sales by Country:** A bar chart or map visual to compare sales performance across different regions.
    - **Profit by Product:** A bar chart identifying the most and least profitable products.
    - **Sales by Segment:** A donut chart or bar chart to show which customer segments contribute the most to revenue.

## üí° Key Insights & Findings
The analysis revealed several key business insights:

- **Strong North American Performance:** The **United States** and **Canada** are the primary drivers of both sales and profitability.
- **Segment Dominance:** The **Government** segment accounts for the largest portion of total sales, but the **Midmarket** segment often yields higher profit margins per sale.
- **Product Profitability:** The **"Paseo"** and **"VTT"** product lines are the most profitable, while the "Velo" product shows inconsistent and sometimes negative returns, requiring further review.
- **Seasonal Trends:** Sales data indicates a consistent peak in performance during the fourth quarter (Q4) of each year.

1.  **Download** the `.pbix` file from this repository.
2.  **Open** the file in Power BI Desktop.
